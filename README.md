# The-Game
A simple game created for school using unity and C# with my classmates in a semester.
The game is a SHMUP (Shoot em up) type game including multiple weapons and enemies as well as a boss battle. You play as Captain Pixie Philips in an endless wave of 'Fly Guys' and UFOs with a boss battle with MAMA_SPACESHIP every 10000 points. Philips is equiped with three weapons and 1-3 on the keyboard are used to select them. One is a forward shooting laser, two is a missile that drops below the ship, and three is a scatter shot that spreads out in front of the ship. Spacebar is used to shoot and wasd or the arrow keys are used to move. The Captain has a health of 3 which is indicated by the hearts on the top left of the screen. UFOs will always drop a health pack when destroyed and Fly Guys do as well but only occasionally. Fly Guys fly torward you and damage on impact. The UFOs fly vertically on the right side of the screen and wrap around in a PacMan style effect. They also damage on impact but their main intent of attack is a spark that it shoots torwards the left side of the screen. The boss battle with MAMA_SPACESHIP plays out in four stages. In the first it shoots at you with a barrage of fast moving bullets. In the second it spawns collumns of Fly Guys towards you. In the third it moves to the middle of the screen and spins as it shoots a barrage of bullets again. In the final stage it moves back to the right side of the screen and shoots at you while spawning Fly Guys.
